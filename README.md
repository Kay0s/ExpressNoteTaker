## Description

To dynamically and quickly create notes data, Express and Heroku were utilized to:

- Serve and display a working data base.
- The user's input was gathered and added as notes which can be deleted.

## Installation

1. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules and .DS store. This ensures that the node_modules directory isn't
   tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
2. Use the command-line, npm install, to install Express.
3. To start saving notes with Express, use the command, node server.js.

## Usage

- Express and Heroku and used to serve and display to the the user web pages to create their HTML ntoes..
- fs.writeFile is used to render the HTML.
- Once the user's information regarding:
  - notes are served:
- An HTML file with the user's saved notes and unique id is created.
- User's saved notes can be deleted based on the id in the db.json.

## Test

Test the different HTML pages/positions on the local host using Express, to ensure that the data is saving and the HTML
page are rendering.
